# US-12: Navigate Between Intervals (Optional/Future)

**As** Thomas
**I might want** to skip ahead or go back an interval
**So that** I can recover from mistakes or repeat an interval

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Back and forward buttons at bottom (inspired by UI screenshots)
- [ ] Forward skips to next interval
- [ ] Back returns to previous interval

## Notes

**Priority:** Lower priority, consider for future iteration
