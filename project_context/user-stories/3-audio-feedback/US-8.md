# US-8: Different Tones for Phase Types

**As** Thomas
**I want** different audio tones for prepare vs work phases
**So that** I can distinguish transitions by sound alone

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Prepare phase uses one tone frequency
- [ ] Work phase uses different tone frequency
- [ ] Final beep of each phase is distinguishable
